To scale up EC2 instances using Terraform, you typically update the **desired instance count** in your `main.tf` file, most often by modifying the `desired_capacity` parameter in your `aws_autoscaling_group` resource. This approach ensures that scaling is managed declaratively and integrates with AWS best practices for high availability and cost control[2][3][4].

**Key steps and considerations:**

- **Review infrastructure changes:**  
  After updating the `desired_capacity` (and possibly `min_size`/`max_size`) in your Terraform configuration, run `terraform plan` to review the proposed changes before applying them. This helps ensure that only the intended scaling action will occur and no unintended resources will be modified[1][2].

- **Validate cost implications:**  
  Increasing the number of EC2 instances will directly increase your AWS costs. Review the instance type, count, and any associated resources (e.g., EBS volumes, load balancers) to estimate the new monthly spend. AWS provides a pricing calculator for this purpose.

- **Schedule deployment window:**  
  Apply the changes during a planned maintenance window to minimize risk and ensure that monitoring and rollback procedures are in place.

- **Update monitoring thresholds:**  
  Adjust your monitoring and alerting systems (e.g., CloudWatch alarms) to reflect the new expected instance count and traffic patterns. This ensures you are alerted to anomalies post-scale-up.

**Terraform example for scaling EC2 via Auto Scaling Group:**

```hcl
resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "autoscale" {
  name                = "example-asg"
  desired_capacity    = 4  # Increase this value to scale up
  max_size            = 6
  min_size            = 2
  launch_template {
    id      = aws_launch_template.example.id
    version = "$Latest"
  }
  vpc_zone_identifier = ["subnet-12345678"]
  health_check_type   = "EC2"
  termination_policies = ["OldestInstance"]
}
```
[2][3]

**Validation steps:**

- Run `terraform validate` to check configuration syntax[4].
- Run `terraform plan` to preview the infrastructure changes[1].
- Apply the changes with `terraform apply` after review.

**Caveats:**

- If you are not using an Auto Scaling Group and are instead managing individual EC2 instances, scaling will require a different approach and may not provide the same flexibility or reliability.
- Always ensure your Terraform state is backed up (e.g., in S3) before making changes, to allow for rollback if necessary[3].

**References to your ticket:**
- The related merge request should be reviewed for code accuracy and compliance with your infrastructure standards.
- Ensure all action items in your ticket are completed before deployment.
