  "content": "Increasing the **aws_instance.web count from 2 to 5** in your Terraform configuration will scale out your web tier by launching three additional EC2 instances. This change directly impacts **availability, cost, and security** as follows:\n\n**Availability**\n- Adding more EC2 instances improves **availability** and resilience, as your web application can handle more concurrent traffic and is less likely to experience downtime if a single instance fails[1][4].\n- However, this manual scaling (changing count) is static. For dynamic, automated scaling based on real-time demand, AWS recommends using **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** with appropriate scaling policies[1][2][4].\n\n**Cost**\n- Increasing the instance count will **raise your AWS costs** proportionally, as you are billed per running instance[1][2].\n- To optimize costs, ensure you are using the right instance types for your workload and consider monitoring usage to avoid overprovisioning[1].\n\n**Security**\n- More instances mean a larger attack surface. Ensure all new instances are configured with **correct security groups**, up-to-date patches, and consistent IAM roles[1].\n- Use **launch templates** to standardize security settings across all instances[1].\n\n**Best Practices and Recommendations**\n- **Enable detailed monitoring** for EC2 instances to get 1-minute CloudWatch metrics, allowing faster detection of scaling needs and health issues[2][3].\n- If not already using ASGs, consider migrating to them for automated, policy-driven scaling, health checks, and integration with Elastic Load Balancers[1][2][4].\n- Group instances by function (e.g., web, backend) to fine-tune scaling and security policies[1].\n- Set up **notifications** for scaling events to maintain operational awareness[2].\n\n**Automation Trigger**\n- The scaling is triggered by a **pull request** to your infrastructure repository, which is a good practice for change control and auditability.\n\n**Caveats**\n- Manual scaling via Terraform is not responsive to real-time traffic changes. For production environments with variable load, automated scaling via ASGs is strongly recommended[1][2][4].\n- Ensure all infrastructure changes are reviewed and tested before deployment to avoid misconfiguration or unintended downtime.\n\nIn summary, increasing EC2 instance count improves availability but raises costs and requires careful security management. For robust, cost-effective scaling, consider adopting AWS Auto Scaling Groups and follow best practices for monitoring, security, and automation[1][2][3][4].",
