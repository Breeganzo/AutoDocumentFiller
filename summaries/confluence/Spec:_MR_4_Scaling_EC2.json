  "content": "Increasing the **aws_instance.web count from 2 to 5** in your Terraform configuration will scale up the number of EC2 instances serving web traffic. This change directly impacts **availability**, **cost**, and **security**.\n\n**Availability**\n- Increasing the number of web EC2 instances improves **availability** and **fault tolerance**. More instances mean your application can handle higher traffic and remain resilient if one or more instances fail[1][2].\n- For optimal reliability, ensure that instances are distributed across multiple **Availability Zones** and consider using **placement groups** if you have specific network or performance requirements[1].\n\n**Cost**\n- Scaling from 2 to 5 EC2 instances will **increase your AWS costs** proportionally, as you are running more compute resources[1].\n- Review your instance types to ensure you are not over-provisioning. Using the wrong instance family or size can lead to unnecessary expenses[1].\n- Enabling **detailed monitoring** (for one-minute CloudWatch metrics) can further increase costs but provides better scaling responsiveness[2][3].\n\n**Security**\n- More instances mean a larger attack surface. Ensure all new instances are launched with the correct **security groups**, **IAM roles**, and **patch levels**[1][5].\n- Use **launch templates** to standardize security configurations across all instances[1].\n- Regularly audit security group rules and instance configurations to avoid misconfigurations as you scale[5].\n\n**Best Practices**\n- Use **Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)** rather than manually setting instance counts, so scaling can be automated based on real-time metrics[1][2].\n- Enable **health checks** (preferably at both EC2 and ELB levels) to ensure only healthy instances serve traffic[2].\n- Group instances by purpose (e.g., separate ASGs for web, backend, batch) for more precise scaling and cost control[1].\n- Set up **notifications** for scaling events to monitor changes and respond quickly to issues[2].\n\n**Automation Trigger**\n- The scaling change is triggered by a **pull request**. Ensure your CI/CD pipeline includes validation steps for infrastructure changes, such as automated security checks and cost estimation.\n\n**Caveats**\n- If you are not using Auto Scaling Groups, you will need to manually adjust the instance count for future scaling needs.\n- Ensure your application and database layers can also handle the increased load to avoid bottlenecks elsewhere.\n\nIn summary, increasing EC2 instance count improves availability but raises costs and security considerations. Automating scaling with best practices and regular audits will help maintain a reliable, secure, and cost-effective infrastructure[1][2][3][5].",
