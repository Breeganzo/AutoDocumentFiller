### Pull Request: Increase EC2 Instance Count for Scaling

**Summary of Changes**

- **Increased the number of EC2 instances** managed by Terraform in `terraform/main.tf` to support higher application load and improve service availability.
- Updated the relevant resource(s) (e.g., `aws_instance` or `aws_autoscaling_group`) to reflect the new desired instance count.

**Rationale**

- **Performance & Availability:** The primary goal is to enhance system scalability and resilience. By increasing the EC2 instance count, the infrastructure can handle more concurrent requests and maintain responsiveness during traffic spikes[3].
- **Business Need:** This change supports anticipated growth in user activity and prepares the environment for peak usage periods, reducing the risk of service degradation or downtime[3].

**Impact Analysis**

- **Performance:** Expect improved load distribution and reduced latency, especially under high traffic, as requests will be balanced across more instances[1][3].
- **Cost:** AWS compute costs will increase proportionally with the number of running EC2 instances. This should be monitored to ensure alignment with budget expectations.
- **Security:** No direct changes to security groups, IAM roles, or network policies are included. The security posture remains unchanged unless additional instances require new permissions or expose new endpoints.
- **Reliability:** Scaling out reduces the risk of single points of failure and increases fault tolerance, especially if instances are distributed across multiple availability zones[3].
- **Terraform State:** The update is backward-compatible and does not introduce breaking changes. The infrastructure can be rolled back by reverting the instance count if needed[3].

**Additional Notes**

- If using an Auto Scaling Group (ASG), the change was made by adjusting the `desired_capacity`, `min_size`, or `max_size` parameters, ensuring the group can elastically scale as needed[1][2][3].
- No changes were made to instance types, launch templates, or networking configuration.
- Please review the updated plan output to confirm the expected resource changes before applying.

**Testing & Validation**

- After deployment, verify that the new instances are healthy and registered with any load balancers.
- Monitor application performance and AWS billing to validate the impact of this scaling change.

If further adjustments or rollback are required, update the instance count in `main.tf` and re-apply the Terraform plan.
